        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal website. Here's a little about who I am.</p>
        <p>
          I am one of six children, the second oldest, and I grew up in Cape
          Town's Cape Flats. Like many who find themselves in this environment,
          life was far from easy. Raised by a single mom who often had no idea
          where our next meal would come from, I quickly learned the value of
          resilience and resourcefulness. Looking back, I realize that these
          challenges have given me a unique advantage. The fact that I came from
          nothing makes me appreciate everything I have today and every
          opportunity I’m given.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2014, my life changed forever when I was blessed with my daughter.
          This moment shook me into a different gear, making me realize that I
          needed to find stability and become a role model for her, even before
          I knew her gender. This realization led me to Capitec Bank, where I
          felt a strong connection and saw myself as a professional. I worked
          hard to sell myself to the staff, eventually getting the chance to
          speak with the branch and regional managers. Despite my lack of
          professional polish at the time, they saw something in me and gave me
          the opportunity to compete for a spot at the company.
        </p>

        <p>
          After two months of tests and interviews, I was welcomed into the
          Capitec family, starting my role just one month before my daughter was
          born. Since then, I’ve worked my way up from a consultant to a senior
          branch manager. Beyond the financial security, my partner (Me Amore),
          and the ability to provide for my family, the greatest gift Capitec
          has given me is the chance to grow, to push my limits, and to bring
          others along on that journey. This is the culture we are creating—a
          place where hard work and ambition are rewarded, and where we lift
          each other up.
        </p>

        <p>
          As you explore the rest of this site, you’ll discover my hobbies and
          interests, from my love of anime to my passion for MMA and learning
          new things. These are not just pastimes; they are reflections of my
          journey, my values, and the way I approach life.
